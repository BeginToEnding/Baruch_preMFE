\section*{Stock return classification}
In this exercise, we will collect financial data on various companies,
and potentially, further inputs that can affect stock prices to predict
whether a stock will go up, stay the same, or go down in the next period.

We then define a simple classification model,
the details of which we obtain from the Baruch ME pre-MFE course.
We label the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Our goal is to show how a multi-dimenional,
multi-label classification problem
can be defined, trained, and used for prediction. Our hope to predict
market movement with any signicant accuracy is low.
    [But whou wouldn't want to be rich?]

\subsection*{Feature selection}
For brainstorming, we considered the features in the appendix.
We concluded in using the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The daily returns are used with different
          averaging windows. While the the weight within the
          window is constant, some more complicated averaging
          methods would be using decreasing weights as time
          difference increases. We can expact that if we went
          with a single averaged parameter, we would need to use
          a narrower window for daily return prediction,
          and a wider window for the monthly return prediction.

          We used a window size of 5 for daily and weekly returns,
          and window size of 3 for monthly returns. When calculating
          the weekly and monthly returns, we took the average over
          that time period, so the frequency of the data changed
          to weekly and monthly. This also means that the window size
          increased to 5 weeks and 3 months.
    \item Tha volatility is also used, where similarly,
          different prediction horizon required different
          time ranges. We took the sample's standard deviation
          over the same time windows as above.
    \item The trading volume is used, with the same
          considerations as above.
    \item As we were not familiar with technical indicators,
          we omitted them from our list.
    \item Price to earning is a widely used metric,
          and we wanted to incorporate it, however,
          it would require earnings data and total number of shares too,
          and our free source yfinance had no data before 2020 for some
          of the stocks.
    \item we selected stocks which pay little to no dividends,
          so we omitted the dividend yield.
    \item We considered the interest rate, however,
          we selected a time frame where the interest rate
          was constant low, so we omitted it.
          This raised a serious limitation on the training
          data, as the interest was low only between 2009 and 2015.
          To collect enough data, later we extended the time frame
          till 2022, when the interest rate was slightly elevated.
          See fig \ref{fig:interest} for the interest rate
          between 2009 and 2022.

\end{enumerate}

        the interest rate was constant low between 2009 and 2015
        and slightly elevated between 2015 and 2022. Overall,
        the interest rate was low during this period compared
        to the historical average. Grey zones indicate recessions.

\subsection*{Data collection}
We restrictred the model to features that are only stock specific and can be calculated from
previous stock prices and volumes. See the collected data in fig \ref{fig:amazon_scaled_data}.
Chartists were people who believed that
the stock price movement can be predicted by previous data patterns.
In this case, we are doing the same, on a small set of features,
but we are using a machine learning model to predict the future price movement.

For code of data collection and preparation, see the attached notebook in the appendix.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{amzn_stock_data_trends.pdf}
    \caption{Stock prices for Amazon, their volatility and trading volume.
        Weekly sampling and moving average window of size 5 is used.
        Normalization is applied, so that the standard deviation of the
        different features and the percentage change of the stock price
        is 1.}
    \label{fig:amazon_scaled_data}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Labeling}
We labeled the data based on the stock price movement.
For every time point $t_i$,
we calcualted moving averages and volatility over the past few data points.
We ensure that the time point $i$ is not included in the calculation,
see technical details in the notebook and how we shifted the data by 1 cell.

We defined a symmetric threshold $\tau$, and labeled the data as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pozitive, $y_i = 1$ if $p_{t_i} > \tau$
    \item neutral, $y_i = 0$ if $\abs{p_{t_i}} < \tau$
    \item negative, $y_i = -1$ if $p_{t_i} < - \tau$,
\end{itemize}

where $p_{t_i}$ is the stock price movement (Pct\_Return) at time $t_i$.

We defined the value for the threshold so that
the number of samples in the neutral band is $1/3$ of the total number of samples.
The number of samples in the positive and negative classes are not necessarily equal.
The distribution of the percentage daily return and the result of the labeling
is shown in fig \ref{fig:amazon_labelled_pct_return}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{amzn_pct_return_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{Percentage daily return distribution for Amazon.
        The threshold is set so that the number of samples in the neutral band
        is $1/3$ of the total number of samples. The difference between the
        positive and negative classes is a sign of the asymmetry of the
        stock price movements.}
