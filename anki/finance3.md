## What is the Fourier transformation of the Gaussian curve?

## What is an estimate what is an estimator?

## What is bias in OLS?

## How do you solve a 2nd order differential equation?

## Let's say we have a biased coin and flipped T already (which had the lower probability). How many flips do we need to have the same number of heads and tails?

## We flip a fair dice 5 times. What is the variance of the frequency of 1s and 2s?

## We have a fair dice, and another dice with 6 faces, integer values, and arbitrary probabbilities. How to set the face values and probabilities of the 2nd dice to that the sum of the two dices is uniform from 1 to 12?
