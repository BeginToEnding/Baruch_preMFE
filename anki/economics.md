## What is economics?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539542 -->

A social science that studies how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants and needs, focusing on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It is an optimization problem with given resource boundary conditions.

## What is opportunity cost?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539547 -->

The cost of the next best alternative that is foregone when making a decision. It represents the value of the benefits that could have been obtained by choosing that alternative instead.

## What is positive analysis and normative analysis

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539550 -->

Positive analysis focuses on describing and explaining economic phenomena without making value judgments, while normative analysis involves making value judgments about what ought to be or what is desirable in economic policies or outcomes.

## What are the 3 preference assumptions?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539553 -->

- completeness: you can tell which one you like more, for every 2 goods
- transitivity: if I like B more than A, and C more than B, then I like C more than A
- non satiation: more is better

## What is a utility function? What are its key properties?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539555 -->

A utility function is a mathematical representation of a consumer's preferences, assigning a numerical value to different combinations of goods and services to reflect the level of satisfaction or utility derived from each combination. Properties:

- Completeness: The utility function can rank all possible combinations of goods.
- Transitivity: If a combination A is preferred to B, and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C.
- Non-satiation: More of a good is always preferred to less, meaning utility increases with more consumption.

## What is marginal utility?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539557 -->

Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. Let $x$ be the quantity of a good, and $U(x)$ be the utility function. Then, marginal utility is defined as:

$$MU(x) = \frac{dU(x)}{dx}$$

## What is an indifference curves? What are its key properties?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539559 -->

An indifference curve in economics represents combinations of two goods that provide a consumer with the same level of satisfaction, meaning they are indifferent to which combination they choose.

Key Properties:

- Downward Sloping
- Convexity (unless the goods are perfect substitutes)
- Non-Intersecting
- Higher Curves Mean Higher Utility

## What is the marginal rate of substitution? What is its properties? How to calculate it?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539561 -->

The negative of slope of the indifference curve at a given quantity of one of the goods, and at a given utility. It must deminish. It tells how much of $y$ you are willing to give up to get one more unit of $x$.

$${\left. {MR{S_{xy}}} \right|_{{x_0},{U_0}}} = {\left. { - \frac{{dy}}{{dx}}} \right|_{{x_0},{U_0}}} = \frac{{{{\left. {M{U_x}} \right|}_{{x_0},{U_0}}}}}{{{{\left. {M{U_y}} \right|}_{{y_0},{U_0}}}}} = \frac{{{{\left. {\frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial x}}} \right|}_{{x_0},{U_0}}}}}{{{{\left. {\frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial y}}} \right|}_{{y_0},{U_0}}}}}$$

where $MU$ is the marginal utility, $x$ is the quantity of product x, $y$ is the quantity of product y.

## What is an indifference map?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539563 -->

The set of indiffererence curves for every utility and for any 2 goods a costumer can consider.

## What is the marginal rate of transformation, what is it equal to in equilibrium?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539565 -->

The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is the rate at which one good can be transformed into another good in production, representing the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good in terms of the other good. In equilibrium, the MRT is equal to the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), meaning that the rate at which consumers are willing to trade one good for another is equal to the rate at which producers can transform one good into another.

## What is opportunity set?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539567 -->

Why pair-covariance and correlation are so powerful?
In a famous example, the effect of something
can be written as a weighted sum of the correlation or covariance.
What is this effect?

## What is the slope of the indifference curve?

<!-- notecardId: 1742165539568 -->

The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), which represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to give up one good in exchange for another while maintaining the same level of utility.

$${\left. {MR{S_{xy}}} \right|_{{x_0},{U_0}}} = {\left. { - \frac{{dy}}{{dx}}} \right|_{{x_0},{U_0}}} = \frac{{{{\left. {M{U_x}} \right|}_{{x_0},{U_0}}}}}{{{{\left. {M{U_y}} \right|}_{{y_0},{U_0}}}}} = \frac{{{{\left. {\frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial x}}} \right|}_{{x_0},{U_0}}}}}{{{{\left. {\frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial y}}} \right|}_{{y_0},{U_0}}}}}$$

## What is the elasticity of demand? What are the meaning of corner values?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796067 -->

$$\varepsilon  = \frac{{\Delta Q/Q_0}}{{\Delta P/P_0}} \leqslant 0$$
$\varepsilon \approx 0$: ineleastic, like buying insulin.

$\varepsilon = -\infty$: elastic, when there are perfect subtitues, like burgers, bottled water (in the presence of competitors).

## What is the income elasticity of demand? What are cases for different values of it?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796072 -->

$$\gamma  = \frac{{\Delta Q/{Q_0}}}{{\Delta I/{I_0}}}$$
If $\gamma > 0$: are normal goods, if $0<\gamma <1$: necessities, $\gamma > 1$: luxuries.

if $\gamma < 0$, they are inferior goods, like fast food: the richer I am, the less I want to buy.

## What is the income effect and the substitution effect?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796075 -->

$${\left. {\frac{{\delta Q}}{{\delta P}}} \right|_{y = {y_0}}} = {\left. {\frac{{\delta Q}}{{\delta P}}} \right|_{{U_0}}} + {\left. {\frac{{\partial Q}}{{\partial I}}} \right|_P} \cdot I$$

$${\text{subst}}{\text{.e}} = {\left. {\frac{{\delta Q}}{{\delta P}}} \right|_{{U_0}}}$$

$${\text{inc}}{\text{.e}} = {\left. {\frac{{\partial Q}}{{\partial I}}} \right|_P} \cdot I$$

Summary in a table:

| goods type | Î” price | subst. eff. | income eff. | total eff. |
| ---------- | :-----: | :---------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| normal     |    +    |      -      |      -      |     -      |
| normal     |    -    |      +      |      +      |     +      |
| inferior   |    +    |      -      |      +      |     ?      |
| inferior   |    -    |      +      |      -      |     ?      |

## Wha is the marginal product of labor?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796077 -->

It is calculated as the derivative of the production function with respect to labor.
$$MP_L = \frac{{\partial q}}{{\partial L}}$$
For high labor values, it is a decreasing function.

## What is marginal product of capital?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796079 -->
It is calculated as the derivative of the production function with respect to capital.
$$MP_K = \frac{{\partial q}}{{\partial K}}$$

## What is isoquant?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796081 -->

It is a curve that represents all the combinations of labor and capital that produce the same level of output.
$$q = f(L,K)$$

## What is the marginal rate of technical substitution?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796083 -->

The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is the rate at which one input (e.g., labor) can be substituted for another input (e.g., capital) while keeping the level of output constant. It is calculated as the negative of the slope of the isoquant curve.
$$MRTS = -\frac{{\partial K}}{{\partial L}}$$
It is equal to the ratio of the marginal products of the inputs:
$$MRTS = \frac{{MP_L}}{{MP_K}}$$

## What is returns to scale?

<!-- notecardId: 1742519796086 -->

Tell the value for $n$ in
$$f(tL,tK) = t^n f(L,K)$$

- if $n=1$, constant returns to scale
- if $n>1$, increasing returns to scale
- if $n<1$, decreasing returns to scale

<!-- notecardId: 1742521036310 -->

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Given: } q = f(L, K), \quad K = \bar{K} \text{ (fixed in short run)} \\
